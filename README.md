# chemotactic_droplets
MATLAB scripts to analyze experimental data on predator-prey droplets, and simulation of chemotactic disks

There are 3 subfolders: 

(1) "exp_analysis" : scripts for analyzing experimental data, to quantify structure formation and motility. 
(2) "sim_code"     : scripts to simulate the dynamics of chemotactic disks. 
(3) "sim_analysis" : scripts to analyze simulation data, to quantify structure formation and motility.

Detailed explanations of the scripts are provided in the subfolders.
