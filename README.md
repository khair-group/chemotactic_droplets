# chemotactic_droplets
MATLAB scripts to analyze experimental data on predator-prey droplets, and simulation of chemotactic disks

There are 4 subfolders: 

(1) "multidroplets_tracking": scripts for tracking the trajectory of experimental droplets and image acquisition.

(2) "exp_analysis" : scripts for analyzing experimental data, to quantify structure formation and motility. 

(3) "sim_code"     : scripts to simulate the dynamics of chemotactic disks. 

(4) "sim_analysis" : scripts to analyze simulation data, to quantify structure formation and motility.

Within each subfolder, there is a file called "about_file.txt", which contains an overview of the scripts present therein.
Detailed explanations of the scripts are provided where applicable.
