Codes for analyzing simulation data and calculating the number of neighbors and the motility function.

The scripts are structured largely similar to that in the "exp_analysis" folder.

The folder "eq_dia" contains simulation results of systems with equally sized BrOct and EFB disks.

(1) The driver routine "sims_mu_eq_dia.m" calls "calc_save_contact_dyn_stats_ens_avg_efb_based" and calculates the ensemble averaged value of the
    maximum number of BrOct in contact with the EFB droplets over the time series.

    "calc_save_contact_dyn_stats_ens_avg_efb_based" in turn calls "ret_contact_dynamics_efb_based" and "dist_calc_bidisp_mix_sim_data" for 
    performing the necessary calculations.

(2) The driver routine "tot_pos_eq.m" calculates the motility function Q(t) by invoking "multi_traj_hvsd" and "calc_qt_mean_std_err". Note that 
    "multi_traj_hvsd" makes use of "single_traj_hvsd". 

Additional descriptions of functions are provided as comments in the respective scripts.
